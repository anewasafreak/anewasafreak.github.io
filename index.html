        <p>Hello, the name's Basil! I'm a 16 year old artist with a vision to try and make the world just a bit more
            colorful.</p>
        <p>Only problem is that I'm lazy. And by lazy I mean the "I wish I was a cat so people wouldn't bother me sleep"
            kind of lazy.</p>
        <p>But that's okay! I'm still (somehow) working on projects, which I might soon show to other people. I also
            draw a lot of people, code, and talk a lot (very hard work).</p>
        <p>Now then, why don't you check out my characters? Or maybe commission me soon? Or just contact me! I'd love to
            talk .)</p>
