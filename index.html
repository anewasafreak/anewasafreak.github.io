            <p>Hello, the name's Kai! I'm a 16 year old artist with a vision to try and make the world a bit more
                colorful.</p>
            <p>Only problem is that I'm lazy. And by lazy I mean the "I wish I was a cat so people wouldn't bother me
                sleep" kind of lazy.</p>
            <p>But that's okay! I'm still (somehow) working on projects, which I might soon show to other people. I also
                draw a lot of people, code, and talk a lot (very hard work).</p>
            <p>Now then, why don't you check out my characters? Or maybe commission me soon? Or just contact me! I'd
                love to talk .)</p>
